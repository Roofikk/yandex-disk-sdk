# Yandex Disk SDK

Yandex Disk SDK is an open source plugin whose goal is to provide the developer with a simple interaction with the Yandex.Disk API to integrate it into the game in Unity. However, not all API requests have been implemented yet, but they are still at the development stage.

## Overview

The plugin provides support for the following features of the Yandex Disk API:

- authorization
- get disk and person information
- get files of folder
- get information about folder
- download/upload files to folder

Requirements:
- Unity 2021.3 (maybe the plugin works in earlier versions like 2019 or 2020, but I haven't checked)
- Newtonsoft.Json

## Configure Your Application

To use the plugin, you must first [create and configure application](https://yandex.ru/dev/oauth/) in the [Yandex OAuth](https://oauth.yandex.ru/client/new/id/).
